# D20 dice

All 20 rolls of a D20 dice animated.

Font used for numbers on dice is [Pirata One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pirata+One).

---

The main branch contains all rolls as webp images sequences. All sequences are 100 frames long and rendered in 25fps. 

Every folder is named according to the number being rolled in the corresponding image sequence.

The image sequences are about 246 MB total.

I've also converted the image sequences to videos, those are on the [videos branch](https://github.com/brilliantdrink/sakura-20d-dice/tree/videos/) for your downloading convenience.
